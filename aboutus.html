             <p>SolvedIt is the brain child of 3 educators turned entrepreneurs who have about 10 years 
                 of experience in the education sector. Though still in their youth years, they have
                  garnered enough experience in the educational sector, specifically i
                   in order to understand and analyse circumstances and problems and thus churn out solutions.
            </p>
                
              <p> 
                They have successfully taught and guided more than 3500 students in total 
                amongst themselves and have helped most of them reach their respective goals. 
                They have led and managed an entire higher secondary school with a progressive
                 module for 5 years.
                
                </p>
                 
               <p>Thus, when the world was engulfed in a global pandemic and the entire 
                   educational sector was going into a downward spiral, there arose a need 
                   to adapt to the demand of the situation. Digitisation of the education sector 
                   had long been started but then it became a necessity. We believed that though 
                   it is difficult to substitute classroom education, innovations can be derived 
                   and products can be made that complement the established system and aids its
                    betterment. Thus, the idea of SolvedIt was conceived with a vision to develop 
                    a range of educational products and services that can improve upon the downsides
                     of the current system whilst retaining and enhancing its upsides.</p>

                just products but to services as well. Even 
                those services that mandates some minimum 
                extent of physical interaction, are available 
                online is some capacity; and education is no exception. 
                 While it is debatable that online classes can ever replace physical classroom experience, the pandemic scenario has been the proof that everything in this world adapts to survive.
