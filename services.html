                    <p>When it comes to educational content development,
                         K12 is the hottest category and we at Solved
                          It have put our efforts where it matters the most. 
                          With a talented line of SMEs, trained and monitored

                           executing this task of creating K12 textbook solutions
                            with maximum volume and minimum reworks.</p>
                       
                     <p> We at Solved It are equipped to create K12 textbook 
                         solutions starting from standard 6 to standard 12.

                          the country. And that’s not all, we can deliver those 
                          textbook solutions in local, vernacular languages as well, 
                          along with the regular languages like English and Hindi.
                           This ensures that now anybody and everybody can reap in
                            the benefits of these textbook solutions, irrespective
                             of their medium of instruction and of course, geographical location.</p>
                        
                      <p>Apart from the regular K12 textbook solutions
                           we also accept projects for creating solutions of
                            popular reference materials – R.D. Sharma in mathematics,
                             H.C. Verma in physics and Selina for ISCE to name a few.
                              We also deliver text and video solutions of previous year 
                              papers of 10th and 12th along with competitive examinations

                     <p>Alongside the K12 textbook solutions, we at Solved It are also in line to produce solutions 
                         pertaining to popular competitive examinations like UPSC, Bank SSC, Bank PO, NDA, Regional
                          Civil Services examinations, etc. In this category we try to provide the solutions as requi
                          your business which could include previous year papers, popular reference materials, specimen 
                          papers, etc.

                        
                      <p> Now it is evident that K12 textbook solutions is the hottest category when we talk
                           about educational content development, but this arena of competitive examinations 
                           is often overlooked by the businesses or understandably, are not on the top of their 
                           priority list. But there seems to be a monumental scope in this category as availability
                            of solutions for these examinations is quite scarce and also the competition is relatively 
                            narrow. Thus it’s a win-win, both, from business point of view as well as the consumer point 
                            of view.</p>
